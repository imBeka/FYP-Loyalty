ADMIN of a coffee shop is setting up the system, i.e. how many points USER gets for spending some money. For example ADMIN can set the system to provide USER with 5 POINTS for each 10 pounds spent.
ADMIN also creates REWARDS that users can exchange for their POINTS. He sets name, description, cost (points required) etc.

A client (USER) comes to the store, buys a cup of coffee and tells the cashier (ADMIN) his [EMAIL | PHONE]
The ADMIN creates a TRANSACTION in the SYSTEM, entering details like SUM (of the purchase), [EMAIL | PHONE] (of the client), [DESCRIPTION] (optional)
The SYSTEM does its job by calculating the amount of points USER gets considering the SUM of his purchase and ADDs POINTS to USER account

In the app, user sees all the REWARDS. Some of the REWARDS might be unavailable for him due to lack of POINTS.
When user accumulated sufficient amount of POINTS, he comes to the cashier and tells him [EMAIL | PHONE] as well as the REWARD he wants.
ADMIN creates a new TRANSACTION entering the USERS [EMAIL | PHONE] and REWARD wanted.
The SYSTEM does its job and subtracts the POINTS from the USER
